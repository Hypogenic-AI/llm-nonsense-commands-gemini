  title: Do LLMs Understand Nonsense Commands?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models may not be able to explain or interpret prompts
    that are optimized to produce nonsensical outputs (such as high-perplexity, non-English
    text), raising the question of whether such prompts are fundamentally different
    from standard English prompts and whether directed jailbreaks are inherently difficult
    to find.

    '
  background:
    description: This idea explores whether LLMs can understand and explain prompts
      that are intentionally optimized to produce nonsensical or high-perplexity outputs,
      such as poems that do not resemble English. The study involves finding such
      prompts, asking the model to explain them, and investigating if models can interpret
      these prompts as they do with standard English, or if such directed jailbreaks
      are rare and difficult to discover.

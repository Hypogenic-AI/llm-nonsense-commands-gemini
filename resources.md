### Resource Gathering Notes

#### Search Strategy
I used a combination of Google Scholar, the arXiv API, and targeted GitHub searches to find relevant resources. The initial broad searches were narrowed down based on the relevance of the titles and abstracts to the research question.

#### Selection Criteria
The main selection criteria were relevance to the research hypothesis, recency of the work, and availability of code or datasets. I prioritized papers that dealt with "interpretable" adversarial attacks and "jailbreaking."

#### Challenges Encountered
The main challenge was the difficulty in using Python libraries within the environment due to dependency issues. This was overcome by using `curl` and `web_fetch` to directly access APIs and download files. Another challenge was that some datasets were gated, requiring a different approach.

#### Gaps and Workarounds
The main gap is the lack of a standardized, large-scale dataset of "nonsense commands." I have addressed this by finding a relevant dataset of jailbreak prompts and a code repository that can be used to generate more prompts.

### Recommendations for Experiment Design

Based on the gathered resources, I recommend:

1. **Primary dataset(s)**: Use the `JailbreakBench/JBB-Behaviors` dataset as a starting point. Augment this dataset with more "nonsense commands" generated using the `AutoDAN-Turbo` code.
2. **Baseline methods**: Use the `TextAttack` library to implement baseline adversarial attacks like PGD and compare them to the interpretable attacks generated by AutoDAN.
3. **Evaluation metrics**: Use a combination of Attack Success Rate and a human-in-the-loop evaluation to measure the "sensicality" of the generated prompts.
4. **Code to adapt/reuse**: The `AutoDAN-Turbo` code should be adapted to generate a diverse set of "nonsense commands" for the experiment.

# Cloned Repositories

## Repo 1: AutoDAN-Turbo
- URL: [https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/AutoDAN-Turbo](https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/AutoDAN-Turbo)
- Purpose: This repository contains the code for AutoDAN-Turbo, a follow-up to the original AutoDAN paper. It provides a method for generating interpretable and effective adversarial attacks against LLMs.
- Location: code/AutoDAN-Turbo/
- Key files: 
    - `main.py`: The main script for running the attacks.
    - `configs/`: Directory containing configuration files for different experiments.
    - `results/`: Directory where the results of the attacks are saved.
- Notes: This code will be very useful for generating a dataset of "nonsense commands" and for understanding how these attacks work.

## Repo 2: TextAttack
- URL: [https://github.com/QData/TextAttack](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack)
- Purpose: A Python library for adversarial attacks, data augmentation, and model training in NLP.
- Location: code/TextAttack/
- Key files:
    - `textattack/`: The main library code.
    - `examples/`: A directory with examples of how to use the library.
- Notes: This library can be used to implement baseline adversarial attacks and to augment our dataset of "nonsense commands."
